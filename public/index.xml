&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a unified framework to explain three major economic downturns: the U.S.
Great Depression, the U.S. Great Recession, and Japan’s Long Recession. Temporary economic
disruptions,such as banking crises and excessive debt accumulation, can drive natural interest rates
into negative territory in the short term. At the same time, structural factors, including
demographic decline and rising inequality, can depress natural interest rates over short and long
horizons. A negative natural interest rate and the zero lower bound (ZLB) are necessary
conditions for a liquidity trap. Credible monetary policy can counteract the adverse effects of
short-run liquidity traps. Diminished monetary policy credibility or persistent negative natural
rates may necessitate fiscal interventions. The framework sheds light on the macroeconomic
challenges of low-interest-rate environments and underscores the central importance of
policy regimes. We close by reflecting on the great macroeconomic question of our time: Will
short-term interest rates collapse back to zero once the inflation surge of the 2020s moves to the
back mirror and the political landscape in the US has dramatically changed?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In standard New Keynesian models, future interest rate cuts have larger effects than current cuts—this is called the forward guidance puzzle. We argue that the forward guidance puzzle is not a puzzle. We show the puzzle arises from an implausibly large monetary regime change, exceeding anything in U.S. history since the Great Depression. By calibrating our model to four regime changes during the U.S. Great Depression, disciplined by changes in long-term bond yields, we find the model’s predictions are broadly consistent with historical data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A slanted-L curve effectively captures the non-linearity of the Phillips curve, as shown using cross-country data from major industrialized economies since 2009. The model demonstrates that at high unemployment, demand increases have limited inflationary effects, while at low unemployment, labor shortages amplify both inflationary pressures and the impact of supply shocks.</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigate the bank lending channel of negative nominal policy rates from an empirical and theoretical perspective. We ﬁnd that retail household deposit rates are subject to a lower bound (DLB). Empirically, once the DLB is met, the pass-through to lending rates and credit volumes is substantially lower and bank equity values decline in response to further policy rate cuts. We construct a banking sector model and use our estimate of the pass-through of negative policy rates to lending rates as an identiﬁed moment to parameterize the model and assess the impact of negative policy rates in general equilibrium. Using the theoretical framework, we derive a suﬃcient statistic for when negative policy rates are expansionary and when they are not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This paper introduces a non-linear New Keynesian Phillips curve (Inv-L NK Phillips Curve) to explain the inflation surge in the 2020s, using job vacancies relative to unemployed workers as a measure of economic slack. It argues that wage rigidity and labor market frictions create strong nonlinearities, suggesting that inflation can be reduced without a severe recession, with the recent surge largely driven by a labor shortage.</description>

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a model of quantitative easing (QE) at the zero lower bound
(ZLB) on the short-term nominal interest rate. QE, which reduces the maturity of
government debt, is effective at the ZLB because it generates expectations of future
monetary expansion in a time-consistent equilibrium. Numerical experiments show that
this effect can be substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The macroeconomic data of the last fifty years have overturned at least two of Kaldor’s famous stylized growth facts: constant interest rates, and a constant labor share. At the same time, the research of Piketty and others has introduced several new and surprising facts: an increase in the financial wealth-to-output ratio in the US, an increase in measured Tobin’s Q, and a divergence between the marginal and average returns on capital. In this paper, we argue that these trends can be explained by an increase in market power and pure profits in the US economy—that is, the emergence of a non-zero-rent economy—along with forces that have led to a persistent long-term decline in real interest rates. We make three parsimonious modifications to the standard neoclassical model to explain these trends. Using recent estimates of the increase in markups and the decrease in real interest rates, we show that our model can quantitatively match these new stylized macroeconomic facts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper revisits and proposes a resolution to an empirical and theoretical controversy between Keynes and the “classics” (or monetarists). The controversy dates to Keynes’s General Theory (1936)—most famously formalized in Hicks’s (1937) classic Econometrica article, in which the IS-LM model is first formally stated. We first replicate empirical tests formulated in the late 1960s and ’70s and show that more recent data have more statistical power and resolve the empirical debate in favor of the Keynesians, at least according to the criteria of the literature at that time. We then show, using a simple dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, that the empirical tests suffer from the Lucas (1976) critique, as the conclusion fundamentally depends upon the assumed policy regime. Nevertheless, we argue, this new empirical result is useful: it provides evidence for the existence of a “Keynesian policy regime” according to which traditional monetary expansion loses its impact in the absence of a policy regime change, in the sense of Sargent (1982).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a toolkit to solve for equilibrium in a computationally efficient way in economies facing the effective lower bound on the nominal interest rate under a special assumption about the underlying shock process, a two-state Markov process with an absorbing state. We illustrate the algorithm in the canonical New Keynesian model by replicating the optimal monetary policy in Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), and we show how the toolkit can be used to analyse the medium-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model developed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. As an application, we show how various policy rules perform relative to the optimal commitment equilibrium. A key conclusion is that previously suggested strategies – such as price level targeting and nominal GDP targeting – do not perform well when there is a small drop in the price level, as observed during the Great Recession, because they do not imply a sufficiently strong commitment to low future interest rates (“make-up strategy”). We propose two new policy rules – the cumulative nominal GDP targeting rule and the symmetric dual-objective targeting rule – that are more robust. Had these policies been in place in 2008, they would have reduced the output contraction by approximately 80 percent. If the Federal Reserve had followed average inflation targeting – which arguably approximates the policy framework announced in August 2020 – the output contraction would have been roughly 25 percent smaller.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional wisdom suggests that medium‐term money neutrality imposes strong limitations on the effects of monetary policy. The point of this paper is that models with medium‐ and long‐term money neutrality are prone to generate nonexistence of equilibria at the effective lower bound (ELB) on interest rates. Nonexistence is suggestive of sharp output contractions—so‐called contractionary black holes—at the ELB. Paradoxically, the case for expansionary monetary policy at the ELB is even stronger in models that feature near money neutrality. The results highlight the benefits of a monetary policy regime in which the central bank temporarily overshoots its inflation target once confronted by the ELB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper studies optimal monetary policy under dynamic debt deleveraging once the zero bound is binding. Unlike the existing literature, the natural rate of interest is endogenous and depends on macroeconomic policy. Optimal monetary policy successfully raises the natural rate of interest by creating an environment that speeds up deleveraging, thus endogenously shortening the duration of the crisis and a binding zero bound. Inflation should be front loaded. Fiscal-policy multipliers can be even higher than in existing models, but depend on the way in which public spending is financed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper re-examines the relationship between population aging and economic growth. We confirm previous research such as Cutler, Poterba, Sheiner, and Summers (1990) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) that show positive correlation between measures of population aging and per-capita output growth. Our contribution is demonstrating that this relationship breaks down when the adjustment of interest rates is inhibited by an effective lower bound on nominal rates as took place during the Great Financial Crisis decade. Indeed, during the “secular stagnation regime” of 2008-2015 that prevailed in a number of countries, aging had a negative impact on living standards, consistent with the secular stagnation hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How accurate is a log-linear approximation of the New Keynesian model when the nominal interest rate is bounded by zero? This paper compares the solution of the exact non-linear model to the log-linear approximation. It finds that the difference is modest. This applies even for extreme events in numerical experiments that replicate the U.S. Great Depression. The exact non-linear model makes the same predictions as the log-linear approximation for key policy questions such as the size and sign of government spending and tax multipliers. It also replicates well known paradoxes like the paradox of toil and the paradox of price flexibility. The paper also reconciles different findings reported in the literature using Calvo versus Rotemberg pricing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several central banks implemented negative policy rates in response to the financial crisis, but there is little consensus on the overall effect of this policy. This column examines the transmission of policy rates to bank lending rates, focusing on the case of Sweden. While the first two cuts in negative territory by the Riksbank appear to have been transmitted to lending rates, transmission seems to have broken down for the second two cuts. The findings suggest diminishing returns on interest rate cuts at negative rates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This paper formalizes and quantifies the secular stagnation hypothesis, defined as a persistently low or negative natural rate of interest leading to a chronically binding zero lower bound (ZLB).  Output-inflation dynamics and policy prescriptions are fundamentally different from those in the standard New Keynesian framework. Using a 56-period quantitative life cycle model, a standard calibration to US data delivers a natural rate ranging from 1.5% to 2%, implying an elevated risk of ZLB episodes for the foreseeable future. We decompose the contribution of demographic and technological factors to the decline in interest rates since 1970 and quantify changes required to restore higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper shows that government spending multiplier at the zero lower bound (ZLB) is larger under sticky information than under sticky prices. Similarly, well known paradoxes, e.g., the paradox of toil and the paradox of flexibility become more severe under sticky information. For the case of sticky information it is important to assume that the fiscal policy intervention coincides with the duration of zero interest rates, while such distinction is less important in some special cases for sticky prices. This allows us to unify and clarify results that may appear to contradict each other in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What are the implications of increased price flexibility on output volatility? In a simple
DSGE model, we show analytically that more flexible prices always amplify output volatility
for supply shocks and also amplify output volatility for demand shocks if monetary policy
does not respond strongly to inflation. More flexible prices often reduce welfare, even under
optimal monetary policy if full efficiency cannot be attained. Our results extend to a model
with both sticky information and/or wages. We estimate a quantitative DSGE model using
Bayesian methods and using counterfactual experiments show that our results from the
simple model continue to apply.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Economists disagree on the macroeconomic role of negative interest rates. This column describes how, due to an apparent zero lower bound on deposit rates, negative policy rates have so far had very limited impact on the deposit rates faced by households and firms, and this lower bound on the deposit rate seems to be causing a decline in pass-through to lending rates as well. Negative interest rates thus appear ineffective in stimulating aggregate demand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper documents how the Icelandic banking system grew from 100 percent of GDP in 1998 to 900 percent of GDP in 2008, when it failed during the global financial crisis. We base our analysis on data from the country’s three largest banks that were made public when the Icelandic parliament lifted, among other things, bank secrecy laws in order to investigate the run-up to the financial crisis. We document how the banks were funded and where the money went, using a comprehensive analysis of their lending. The recovery from the crisis was based on policy decisions that, in hindsight, seem to have worked well. We analyze some of these policies—including emergency legislation, capital controls, alleviation of balance of payments risks, and preservation of financial stability. We also estimate the crisis’s output costs, which were about average when compared with the 147 banking crises documented by Luc Laeven and Fabián Valencia (2012) and the 100 banking crises documented by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff (2014). Our computation of the Icelandic government’s direct costs reveals that its recently concluded negotiations with foreign creditors may even leave it with a net surplus as a consequence of the crisis. However, there is still uncertainty about the ultimate cost, and our benchmark estimate is that the cost was about 5 percent of GDP. We summarize several lessons from the episode.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We introduce liquidity frictions into an otherwise standard DSGE model with nominal and real rigidities and ask: can a shock to the liquidity of private paper lead to a collapse in short-term nominal interest rates and a recession like the one associated with the 2008 US financial crisis? Once the nominal interest rate reaches the zero bound, what are the effects of interventions in which the government provides liquidity in exchange for illiquid private paper? We find that the effects of the liquidity shock can be large, and show some numerical examples in which the liquidity facilities of the Federal Reserve prevented a repeat of the Great Depression in the period 2008-2009.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Conditions of secular stagnation—low interest rates, below target inflation, and sluggish output growth—characterize much of the global economy. We consider an overlapping generations, open economy model of secular stagnation, and examine the effect of capital flows on the transmission of stagnation. In a world with a low natural rate of interest, greater capital integration transmits recessions across countries as opposed to lower interest rates. In a global secular stagnation, expansionary fiscal policy carries positive spillovers implying gains from coordination, and fiscal policy is self-financing. Expansionary monetary policy, by contrast, is beggar-thy-neighbor with output gains in one country coming at the expense of the other. Similarly, we find that competitiveness policies including structural labor market reforms or neomercantilist trade policies are also beggar-thy-neighbor in a global secular stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The secular stagnation hypothesis suggests that low interest rates may be the new normal in years to come. This column argues that this prospect should not only lead to a major rethinking of policy from the perspective of individual economies, but also a major rethinking about monetary and fiscal policy in the international context, the role of international capital flows, and the role of policy coordination across borders. In times of secular stagnation, events such as Brexit or the recent turbulence in Turkey have much larger spillover effects than under normal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first show that, at least in theory, open market operations in real assets can be a useful tool for overcoming a liquidity trap because they change the inflation incentives of the government, and thus change private sector expectations from deflationary to inflationary. We argue that this formalizes Ben Bernanke&amp;rsquo;s arbitrage argument for why a central bank can always increase nominal demand, despite the zero lower bound. We illustrate this logic in a calibrated New Keynesian model assuming the government acts under discretion. Numerical experiments suggest, however, that the needed intervention is incredibly high, creating a serious limitation of this solution to the liquidity trap. Our experiments suggest that while asset purchases can be a helpful commitment device in theory, they may need to be combined in practice with fiscal policy coordination to achieve the desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Conditions of secular stagnation&amp;ndash;low interest rates, below target inflation, and sluggish output growth&amp;ndash;now characterize much of the global economy. We consider a simple two-country textbook model to examine how capital markets transmit secular stagnation and to study policy externalities across countries. We find capital flows transmit recessions in a world with low interest rates and that policies that attempt to boost national saving are beggar-thy-neighbor. Monetary expansion cannot eliminate a secular stagnation and may have beggar-thy-neighbor effects, while sufficiently large fiscal interventions can eliminate a secular stagnation and carry positive externalities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s two-decade-long malaise and the Great Recession have renewed interest in the secular stagnation hypothesis, but until recently this theory has not been explicitly formalised. This chapter explains the core logic of a new model that does just that. In the model, an increase in inequality, a slowdown in population growth, and a tightening of borrowing limits all reduce the equilibrium real interest rate. Unlike in other recent models, a period of deleveraging puts even more downward pressure on the real interest rate so that it becomes permanently negative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This study summarizes a theory of the origin of the current world economic crisis and the role of fiscal policy in mitigating its effect. The perspective is dynamic stochastic general equilibrium analysis. Overall, the model analysis suggests a strong case for fiscal policy if the monetary authority is unable/unwilling to close the output gap. This remains the case, even when explicitly taking into account public debt dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Structural reforms that increase competition in product and labor markets are often indicated as the main policy option available for peripheral Europe to regain competitiveness and boost output. We show that, in a crisis that pushes the nominal interest rate to its lower bound, these reforms do not support economic activity in the short run, and may well be contractionary. In the absence of the appropriate monetary stimulus, reforms fuel expectations of prolonged deflation, increase the real interest rate, and depress aggregate demand. Our findings carry important implications for the current debate on the timing and the design of structural reforms in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper analyzes the effectiveness of fiscal policy at zero nominal interest rates. I solve a stochastic general equilibrium model with sticky prices assuming that the government cannot commit to future policy. Real government spending increases demand by boosting public consumption. Deficit spending increases demand by generating inflation expectations. I compute multipliers of government spending that calculate by how much each dollar of spending increases output. Both the deficit and the real spending multipliers can be large, but the multiplier of deficit spending depends critically on monetary and fiscal cooperation: it can be large with cooperation and zero without it. The theory suggests one interesting interpretation of why recovery measures–such as fiscal spending, exchange interventions, and large increases in the money supply–had a smaller effect on nominal demand in Japan during the Great Recession (1992-2006) than during the US&amp;rsquo;s Great Depression (1929-1941). In both episodes, the short-term nominal interest rate was close to zero. The theory suggests that part of the difference can be explained by the fact that, while monetary and fiscal policy were coordinated in the US during the Great Depression, they were not in Japan during the Great Recession. The overall conclusion of the paper is that the effect of given policy actions depends crucially on the institutional setup in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Cutting government spending on goods and services increases the budget deficit if the nominal interest rate is close to zero. This is the message of a simple but standard New Keynesian DSGE model calibrated with Bayesian methods. The cut in spending reduces output and thus?holding rates for labor and sales taxes constant?reduces revenues by even more than what is saved by the spending cut. Similarly, increasing sales taxes can increase the budget deficit rather than reduce it. Both results suggest limitations of ?austerity measures? in low interest rate economies to cut budget deficits. Running budget deficits can by itself be either expansionary or contractionary for output, depending on how deficits interact with expectations about the long run in the model. If deficits trigger expectations of i) lower long-run government spending, ii) higher long-run sales taxes, or iii) higher future inflation, they are expansionary. If deficits trigger expectations of higher long-run labor taxes or lower long-run productivity, they are contractionary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article we present a simple new Keynesian&amp;ndash;style model of debt-driven slumps&amp;ndash;that is, situations in which an overhang of debt on the part of some agents, who are forced into rapid deleveraging, is depressing aggregate demand. Making some agents debt-constrained is a surprisingly powerful assumption. Fisherian debt deflation, the possibility of a liquidity trap, the paradox of thrift and toil, a Keynesian-type multiplier, and a rationale for expansionary fiscal policy all emerge naturally from the model. We argue that this approach sheds considerable light both on current economic difficulties and on historical episodes, including Japan&amp;rsquo;s lost decade (now in its 18th year) and the Great Depression itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can government policies that increase the monopoly power of firms and the militancy of unions increase output? This paper shows that the answer is yes under certain &amp;ldquo;emergency&amp;rdquo; conditions. These emergency conditions&amp;ndash;zero interest rates and deflation&amp;ndash;were satisfied during the Great Depression in the United States. The New Deal, which facilitated monopolies and union militancy, was therefore expansionary in the model presented. This conclusion is contrary to a large previous literature. The main reason for this divergence is that this paper incorporates rigid prices and the zero bound on the short-term interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax cuts can deepen a recession if the short-term nominal interest rate is zero, according to a standard New Keynesian business cycle model. An example of a contractionary tax cut is a reduction in taxes on wages. This tax cut deepens a recession because it increases deflationary pressures. Another example is a cut in capital taxes. This tax cut deepens a recession because it encourages people to save instead of spend at a time when more spending is needed. Fiscal policies aimed directly at stimulating aggregate demand work better. These policies include 1) a temporary increase in government spending; and 2) tax cuts aimed directly at stimulating aggregate demand rather than aggregate supply, such as an investment tax credit or a cut in sales taxes. The results are specific to an environment in which the interest rate is close to zero, as observed in large parts of the world today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a simple theory to explain why, and under what circumstances, a politician delegates policy tasks to a technocrat in an independent institution and then analyze under what conditions delegation is optimal for society. Our theory builds on Holmstrˆm&amp;rsquo;s (1982, 1999)&amp;ldquo;hidden effort&amp;rdquo; principal-agent model. The election pressures that politicians face, and the absence of such pressures for technocrats, give rise to a dynamic incentive structure that formalizes two rationales for delegation, one highlighted by Hamilton (1788) and the other by Blinder (1998). Delegation trades off the cost of having a possibly incompetent technocrat with a long-term job contract against the benefit of having a technocrat who (i) invests more effort into the specialized policy task and (ii) is better insulated from the whims of public opinion. A natural application of our framework suggests a new theory of central bank independence. Copyright (c) 2010 The Ohio State University.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This note studies Casey Mulligan’s empirical test of the paradox of toil. Mulligan proposes that one can test it by checking if an increase in labor supply, due to seasonal factors, reduced output in 2009. This note shows that in the context of the standard New Keynesian model this test is invalid. The note also discusses two other tests proposed by Mulligan and suggests that they do not resolve the controversy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This paper outlines a simple Bayesian methodology for estimating tax and spending multipliers in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. After forming priors about the parameters of the model and the relevant shock, we used the model to exactly match only one data point: the trough of the Great Depression, that is, an output collapse of 30 percent, deflation of 10 percent, and a zero short-term nominal interest rate. Because we form our priors as distributions, the key economic inference of our analysis―the multipliers of tax and spending―are well-defined probability distributions derived from the posterior of the model. While the Bayesian methods used are standard, the application is slightly unusual. We conjecture that this methodology can be applied in several different settings with severe data limitations and where more informal calibrations have been the norm. The main advantage over usual calibration exercises is that the posterior of the model offers an interesting way to think about sensitivity analysis and gives researchers a useful way to describe model-based inference. We apply our simple estimation method to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), passed by Congress as part of the 2009 stimulus plan. The mean of our estimate indicates that ARRA increased output by 3.6 percent in 2009 and 2010. The standard deviation of this estimate is 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This paper suggests that the US recovery from the Great Depression was driven by a shift in expectations. This shift was caused by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&amp;rsquo;s policy actions. On the monetary policy side, Roosevelt abolished the gold standard and &amp;ndash; even more importantly &amp;ndash; announced the explicit objective of inflating the price level to pre-Depression levels. On the fiscal policy side, Roosevelt expanded real and deficit spending, which made his policy objective credible. These actions violated prevailing policy dogmas and initiated a policy regime change as in Sargent (1983) and Temin and Wigmore (1990). The economic consequences of Roosevelt are evaluated in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with nominal frictions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A liquidity trap is defined as a situation in which the short-term nominal interest rate is zero. The old Keynesian literature emphasized that increasing money supply has no effect in a liquidity trap so that monetary policy is ineffective. The modern literature, in contrast, emphasizes that, even if increasing the current money supply has no effect, monetary policy is far from ineffective at zero interest rates. What is important, however, is not the current money supply but managing expectations about the future money supply in states of the world in which interest rates are positive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We solve for the optimal time-consistent monetary policy in the New Keynesian model with repeated simultaneous play between the monetary authority, households, and rms. Recent work on optimal time-consistent monetary policy has emphasized the existence of multiple Markov perfect equilibria in the New Keynesian model (e.g., King and Wolman, 2004). In this paper, we show that this multiplicity is not intrinsic to the New Keynesian model itself, but is instead driven by an auxiliary timing assumption by previous authors that play is repeated Stackelberg in which the monetary authority must pre-commit each period to a value for the monetary instrument as opposed to repeated simultaneous, in which the monetary authority and the private sector determine the economic equilibrium simultaneously and jointly each period. A contribution of our paper is to show how to de ne the game between the monetary authority, households, and rms with repeated simultaneous play and aggregate resource constraints. We show that the repeated simultaneous play assumption is the proper generalization of the large existing literature on linear-quadratic optimal monetary policy under uncertainty (e.g., Woodford, 2003, Svensson and Woodford, 2003, 2004). We highlight and discuss additional advantages of the repeated simultaneous play assumption. Finally, we derive a closed-form solution for the set of all possible Markov perfect equilibria in the two-period Taylor contracting version of the New Keynesian model with simultaneous play and show that the equilibrium in that model is unique.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper studies a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with sticky prices and rational expectations in an environment of low interest rates and deflationary pressures. We show that small changes in the public&amp;rsquo;s beliefs about the future inflation target of the government can lead to large swings in both inflation and output. This effect is much larger at low interest rates than under regular circumstances. This highlights the importance of effective communication policy at zero interest rates. We argue that confusing communications by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the President of the United States, and key administration officials about future price objectives were responsible for the sharp recession in the United States in 1937?38, one of the sharpest recessions in U.S. economic history. Poor communication policy is the mistake of 1937. Before committing the mistake of 1937, the U.S. policymakers faced economic conditions that are similar in some respects to those confronted by Japanese policymakers in the first half of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous work (Eggertsson and Woodford, 2003), we characterized the optimal conduct of monetary policy when a real disturbance causes the natural rate of interest to be temporarily negative, so that the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates binds, and showed that commitment to a history-dependent policy rule can greatly increase welfare relative to the outcome under a purely forward-looking inflation target. Here we consider in addition optimal tax policy in response to such a disturbance, to determine the extent to which fiscal policy can help to mitigate the distortions resulting from the zero bound, and to consider whether a history-dependent monetary policy commitment continues to be important when fiscal policy is appropriately adjusted. We find that even in a model where complete tax smoothing would be optimal as long as the zero bound never binds, it is optimal to temporarily adjust tax rates in response to a binding zero bound; but when taxes have only a supply-side effect, the optimal policy requires that the tax rate be raised during the &amp;ldquo;trap&amp;rdquo;, while committing to lower tax rates below their long-run level later. An optimal policy commitment is still history-dependent, in general, but the gains from departing from a strict inflation target are modest in the case that fiscal policy responds to the real disturbance in an appropriate way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I model deflation, at zero nominal interest rate, in a microfounded general equilibrium model. I show that one can analyze deflation as a credibility problem if three conditions are satisfied. First: The government&amp;rsquo;s only policy instrument is increasing the money supply by open market operations in short-term bonds. Second: The economy is subject to large negative demand shocks. Third: The government cannot commit to future policy. I call the credibility problem that arises under these conditions the deflation bias. I propose several policies to solve it. They all involve printing money or issuing nominal debt. In addition they require cutting taxes, buying real assets such as stocks, or purchasing foreign exchange. The government &amp;ldquo;credibly commits to being irresponsible&amp;rdquo; by pursuing these policies. It commits to higher money supply in the future so that the private sector expects inflation instead of deflation. This is optimal since it curbs deflation and increases output by lowering the real rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the effects of quantitative easing implemented by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) since early 2001, looking specifically at the impact on inflation expectations and real asset prices. It suggests a number of possible channels through which quantitative easing may have exerted influence, and reviews some of the empirical evidence linking open market operations and long-term bond purchases to real yields and other asset prices. It argues that quantitative easing has had smaller effects on nominal and real variables than desired, mainly because the BoJ has not succeeded in credibly communicating its policy intentions once the zero bound on short-term rates ceases to be binding. It argues that setting clear goals for inflation and a return to interest rate targeting are not only key elements of a successful strategy to avoid deflation, but are also essential to pin down expectations and avoid instability once deflation wanes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This dissertation explores optimal monetary and fiscal policy at low nominal interest rates. Policy at low interest rates is challenging since the principal instrument of central banks is the shortterm nominal interest rate and it cannot be set below zero. This can be particularly problematic in adeflationary environment when the government wants to stimulate the economy but is constrained by the zero bound. Recent events in Japan (where the interest rate has been close to zero for the past several years) and the lowest short-term interest rate in the US in the past 45 years make this an urgent topic of research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This paper considers the consequences for monetary policy of the zero floor for nominal interest rates. The zero bound can be a significant constraint on the ability of a central bank to combat deflation. The paper shows, in the context of an intertemporal equilibrium model, that open-market operations, even of &amp;ldquo;unconventional&amp;rdquo; types, are ineffective if future policy is expected to be purely forward looking. However, a credible commitment to the right sort of history-dependent policy can largely mitigate the distortions created by the zero bound. In the model, optimal policy involves a commitment to adjust interest rates so as to achieve a time-varying price-level target, when this is consistent with the zero bound. The paper also discusses ways in which other central bank actions, although irrelevant apart from their effects on expectations, may help to make a central bank&amp;rsquo;s commitment to its target more credible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I model deflation, at zero nominal interest rate, in a micro founded general equilibrium model.
I show that deflation can be analyzed as a credibility problem if the government has only one
policy instrument, money supply carried out by means of open market operations in shortterm
bonds, and cannot commit to future policies. I propose several policies to solve the
credibility problem. They involve printing money or nominal debt and either (1) cutting
taxes, (2) buying real assets such as stocks, or (3) purchasing foreign exchange. The
government credibly &amp;ldquo;commits to being irresponsible&amp;rdquo; by using these policy instruments. It
commits to higher money supply in the future so that the private sector expects inflation
instead of deflation. This is optimal, since it curbs deflation and increases output by lowering
the real rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper explores the peculiar credibility problem that a zero bound on the short-term
nominal interest rate, the liquidity trap, poses to monetary and fiscal policy. We present a
rational expectations model in which the zero bound on short-term nominal interest rates is
binding due to deflationary shocks. When the zero bound is binding the Central Bank best
achieves its objectives by generating inflation expectations to lower the real rate of interest
and stimulate aggregate demand. A discretionary Central Bank that is independent from
fiscal policy, however, cannot credibly commit to inflation. The result is a liquidity trap that
is characterized by excessive deflation and a negative output gap. This ìdeflation biasî is
the opposite of the ìinflation biasî analyzed by Barro/Gordon (1983) and Kydland/Prescott
(1977). Turning to fiscal policy, our model implies that if the Central Bank is independent then
Ricardian equivalence holds and deficit spending, i.e. tax cuts and debt accumulation, has no
effect. Our proposed solution involves abolishing the independence of the Central Bank. If
fiscal and monetary policies are coordinated, Ricardian Equivalence fails, and the government
can credibly commit to future inflation by deficit spending. As a result it lowers the real rate
of return, curbs deflation and increases output. Finally we address what coordination of fiscal
and monetary policy might entail in practice. We review the applicability of our model to the
current situation in Japan. We then discuss the extent to which the successful policies pursued
in Japan during the Great Depression can be rationalized by our model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper explores the effects of real government spending in a New Keynesian model. A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;social welfare criterion is derived by a second order Taylor expansion of the representative household utility. The welfare criterion includes inflation, output gap and the deviation of government
spending from a time varying target level. Using this welfare criterion, optimal monetary and fiscal policy are analyzed. This paper shows that even if Ricardian Equivalence holds, real spending can have substantial effects on output and prices. This is particularly relevant in a liquidity trap since then the effectiveness of monetary policy is reduced by the zero bound. The only way the government can use monetary policy in a liquidity trap to influence aggregate demand is by committing to future monetary actions that are dynamically inconsistent. On the other hand, increasing real government spending involves current action and is thus not subject to the same credibility problem. For a government that cannot credibly commit to future policies, varying real government spending is therefore a particularly effective policy tool in a liquidity trap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We propose an overlapping generations New Keynesian model in which a permanent (or very persistent) slump is possible without any self-correcting force to full employment. The trigger for the slump is a deleveraging shock, which creates an oversupply of savings. Other forces that work in the same direction and can both create or exacerbate the problem include a drop in population growth, an increase in income inequality, and a fall in the relative price of investment. Our model sheds light on the long persistence of the Japanese crisis, the Great Depression, and the slow recovery out of the Great Recession. It also highlights several implications for policy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a new paradox: the paradox of toil. Suppose everyone wakes up one day and decides they want to work more. What happens to aggregate employment? This paper shows that, under certain conditions, aggregate employment falls; that is, there is less work in the aggregate because everyone wants to work more. The conditions for the paradox to apply are that the short-term nominal interest rate is zero and there are deflationary pressures and output contraction, much as during the Great Depression in the United States and, perhaps, the 2008 financial crisis in large parts of the world. The paradox of toil is tightly connected to the Keynesian idea of the paradox of thrift. Both are examples of a fallacy of composition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve has raised rates twice since the 2016 US election and eyes are now on the future path of the Federal Funds rate, which depends crucially on the Fed’s view of the neutral rate of interest. This column argues that that current policy may be at or close to the natural rate, and that the forces that have led to the low rates are unlikely to be reversed in the immediate future. It also identifies measures that could eliminate secular stagnation via appropriate policy, should negative rates persist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
