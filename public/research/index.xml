      <description>A slanted-L curve effectively captures the non-linearity of the Phillips curve, as shown using cross-country data from major industrialized economies since 2009. The model demonstrates that at high unemployment, demand increases have limited inflationary effects, while at low unemployment, labor shortages amplify both inflationary pressures and the impact of supply shocks.</description>

      <description>This paper introduces a non-linear New Keynesian Phillips curve (Inv-L NK Phillips Curve) to explain the inflation surge in the 2020s, using job vacancies relative to unemployed workers as a measure of economic slack. It argues that wage rigidity and labor market frictions create strong nonlinearities, suggesting that inflation can be reduced without a severe recession, with the recent surge largely driven by a labor shortage.</description>

      <description>The Fed’s substantial revisions to its monetary policy strategy in August 2020 and its forward guidance contributed to the largely unanticipated and most definitely unwelcome surge in inflation during the pandemic.</description>
