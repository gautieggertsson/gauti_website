      <title>The Slanted-L Phillips Curve</title>

      <description>A slanted-L curve effectively captures the non-linearity of the Phillips curve, as shown using cross-country data from major industrialized economies since 2009. The model demonstrates that at high unemployment, demand increases have limited inflationary effects, while at low unemployment, labor shortages amplify both inflationary pressures and the impact of supply shocks.</description>

      <title>It’s Baaack: The Inflation Surge of 2020s and the Return of the Non-Linear Phillips Curve</title>

      <description>This paper introduces a non-linear New Keynesian Phillips curve (Inv-L NK Phillips Curve) to explain the inflation surge in the 2020s, using job vacancies relative to unemployed workers as a measure of economic slack. It argues that wage rigidity and labor market frictions create strong nonlinearities, suggesting that inflation can be reduced without a severe recession, with the recent surge largely driven by a labor shortage.</description>

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a unified framework to explain three major economic downturns: the U.S.
Great Depression, the U.S. Great Recession, and Japan’s Long Recession. Temporary economic
disruptions,such as banking crises and excessive debt accumulation, can drive natural interest rates
into negative territory in the short term. At the same time, structural factors, including
demographic decline and rising inequality, can depress natural interest rates over short and long
horizons. A negative natural interest rate and the zero lower bound (ZLB) are necessary
conditions for a liquidity trap. Credible monetary policy can counteract the adverse effects of
short-run liquidity traps. Diminished monetary policy credibility or persistent negative natural
rates may necessitate fiscal interventions. The framework sheds light on the macroeconomic
challenges of low-interest-rate environments and underscores the central importance of
policy regimes. We close by reflecting on the great macroeconomic question of our time: Will
short-term interest rates collapse back to zero once the inflation surge of the 2020s moves to the
back mirror and the political landscape in the US has dramatically changed?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Forward Guidence Puzzle is not a Puzzle</title>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In standard New Keynesian models, future interest rate cuts have larger effects than current cuts—this is called the forward guidance puzzle. We argue that the forward guidance puzzle is not a puzzle. We show the puzzle arises from an implausibly large monetary regime change, exceeding anything in U.S. history since the Great Depression. By calibrating our model to four regime changes during the U.S. Great Depression, disciplined by changes in long-term bond yields, we find the model’s predictions are broadly consistent with historical data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Inflation Surge of the 2020: The Role of Monetary Policy</title>

      <description>The Fed’s substantial revisions to its monetary policy strategy in August 2020 and its forward guidance contributed to the largely unanticipated and most definitely unwelcome surge in inflation during the pandemic.</description>
