##### Abstract
This paper proposes a post-crisis New Keynesian model that incorporates agent heterogeneity in borrowing and lending with a minimum set of assumptions and complexity. Unlike the standard framework, this model makes the natural rate of interest endogenous, and dependent on macroeconomic policy. We establish microfoundations
for debt deleveraging based both on the accumulation of excessive debt by households and leverage constraints on banks, showing that they are isomorphic and thus integrating two popular narratives for the crisis of 2008. The main application is to study optimal monetary policy at the zero lower bound (ZLB). Such policy succeeds in raising the natural rate of interest by creating an environment that speeds up deleveraging and thus endogenously shortens the crisis and the duration of binding ZLB. Inflation should be front-loaded and overshoot its long term target during the ZLB episode.
