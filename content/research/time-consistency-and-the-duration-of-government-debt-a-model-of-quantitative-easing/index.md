##### Abstract
This paper presents a model of quantitative easing (QE) at the zero lower bound
(ZLB) on the short-term nominal interest rate. QE, which reduces the maturity of
government debt, is effective at the ZLB because it generates expectations of future
monetary expansion in a time-consistent equilibrium. Numerical experiments show that
this effect can be substantial.
