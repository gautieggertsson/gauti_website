summary: "This paper introduces a non-linear New Keynesian Phillips curve (Inv-L NK Phillips Curve) to explain the inflation surge in the 2020s, using job vacancies relative to unemployed workers as a measure of economic slack. It argues that wage rigidity and labor market frictions create strong nonlinearities, suggesting that inflation can be reduced without a severe recession, with the recent surge largely driven by a labor shortage."

##### Abstract

This paper proposes a non-linear New Keynesian Phillips curve (Inv-L NK Phillips Curve) to explain the surge of inflation in the 2020s. Economic slack is measured as firms' job vacancies over the number of unemployed workers. After showing empirical evidence of statistically significant nonlinearities, we propose a New Keynesian model with search and matching frictions, complemented by a form of wage rigidity, in the spirit of Phillips (1958), that generates strong nonlinearities. Policy implications include the thesis that appropriate monetary policy can bring inflation down without a significant recession and that the recent inflationary surge was mostly generated by a labor shortage -- i.e. an exceptionally tight labor market.
