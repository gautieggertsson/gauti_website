##### Abstract
This paper explores the peculiar credibility problem that a zero bound on the short-term
nominal interest rate, the liquidity trap, poses to monetary and fiscal policy. We present a
rational expectations model in which the zero bound on short-term nominal interest rates is
binding due to deflationary shocks. When the zero bound is binding the Central Bank best
achieves its objectives by generating inflation expectations to lower the real rate of interest
and stimulate aggregate demand. A discretionary Central Bank that is independent from
fiscal policy, however, cannot credibly commit to inflation. The result is a liquidity trap that
is characterized by excessive deflation and a negative output gap. This ìdeflation biasî is
the opposite of the ìinflation biasî analyzed by Barro/Gordon (1983) and Kydland/Prescott
(1977). Turning to fiscal policy, our model implies that if the Central Bank is independent then
Ricardian equivalence holds and deficit spending, i.e. tax cuts and debt accumulation, has no
effect. Our proposed solution involves abolishing the independence of the Central Bank. If
fiscal and monetary policies are coordinated, Ricardian Equivalence fails, and the government
can credibly commit to future inflation by deficit spending. As a result it lowers the real rate
of return, curbs deflation and increases output. Finally we address what coordination of fiscal
and monetary policy might entail in practice. We review the applicability of our model to the
current situation in Japan. We then discuss the extent to which the successful policies pursued
in Japan during the Great Depression can be rationalized by our model.
