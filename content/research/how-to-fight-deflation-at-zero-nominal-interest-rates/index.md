##### Abstract
I model deflation, at zero nominal interest rate, in a micro founded general equilibrium model.
I show that deflation can be analyzed as a credibility problem if the government has only one
policy instrument, money supply carried out by means of open market operations in shortterm
bonds, and cannot commit to future policies. I propose several policies to solve the
credibility problem. They involve printing money or nominal debt and either (1) cutting
taxes, (2) buying real assets such as stocks, or (3) purchasing foreign exchange. The
government credibly "commits to being irresponsible" by using these policy instruments. It
commits to higher money supply in the future so that the private sector expects inflation
instead of deflation. This is optimal, since it curbs deflation and increases output by lowering
the real rate of return.
