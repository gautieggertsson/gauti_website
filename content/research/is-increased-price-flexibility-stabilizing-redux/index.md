##### Abstract
What are the implications of increased price flexibility on output volatility? In a simple
DSGE model, we show analytically that more flexible prices always amplify output volatility
for supply shocks and also amplify output volatility for demand shocks if monetary policy
does not respond strongly to inflation. More flexible prices often reduce welfare, even under
optimal monetary policy if full efficiency cannot be attained. Our results extend to a model
with both sticky information and/or wages. We estimate a quantitative DSGE model using
Bayesian methods and using counterfactual experiments show that our results from the
simple model continue to apply.
