##### Abstract

This paper presents a unified framework to explain three major economic downturns: the U.S.
Great Depression, the U.S. Great Recession, and Japan’s Long Recession. Temporary economic
disruptions,such as banking crises and excessive debt accumulation, can drive natural interest rates
into negative territory in the short term. At the same time, structural factors, including
demographic decline and rising inequality, can depress natural interest rates over short and long
horizons. A negative natural interest rate and the zero lower bound (ZLB) are necessary
conditions for a liquidity trap. Credible monetary policy can counteract the adverse effects of
short-run liquidity traps. Diminished monetary policy credibility or persistent negative natural
rates may necessitate fiscal interventions. The framework sheds light on the macroeconomic
challenges of low-interest-rate environments and underscores the central importance of
policy regimes. We close by reflecting on the great macroeconomic question of our time: Will
short-term interest rates collapse back to zero once the inflation surge of the 2020s moves to the
back mirror and the political landscape in the US has dramatically changed?
