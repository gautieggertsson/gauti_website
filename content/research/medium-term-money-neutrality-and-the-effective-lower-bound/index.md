##### Abstract
Conventional wisdom suggests that medium-term money neutrality imposes strong limitations on 
the effects of monetary policy. The point of this paper is that models with medium- and long-term 
money  neutrality  are  prone  to  generate  non-existence  of  equilibria  at  the  effective  lower  bound 
(ELB) on  interest  rates.  Non-existence  is  suggestive  of  sharp  output  contractions  ---  so-called 
contractionary  black  holes  ---  at  the  ELB.  Paradoxically,  the  case  for  expansionary  monetary 
policy  at  the  ELB  is  even  stronger  in  models  that  feature  near  money  neutrality.  The  results 
highlight  the  benefits  of  a  monetary  policy  regime  in  which  the  central  bank  temporarily 
overshoots its inflation target once confronted by the ELB.
