##### Abstract
The macroeconomic data of the last fifty years have overturned at least two of Kaldor’s famous stylized
growth facts: constant interest rates, and a constant labor share. At the same time, the research of

Piketty and others has introduced several new and surprising facts: an increase in the financial wealth-
to-output ratio in the US, an increase in measured Tobin’s Q, and a divergence between the marginal and

average returns on capital. In this paper, we argue that these trends can be explained by an increase in
market power and pure profits in the US economy—that is, the emergence of a non-zero-rent economy—
along with forces that have led to a persistent long-term decline in real interest rates. We make three
parsimonious modifications to the standard neoclassical model to explain these trends. Using recent
estimates of the increase in markups and the decrease in real interest rates, we show that our model can
quantitatively match these new stylized macroeconomic facts.
